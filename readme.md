# REGEX TO REFRESH MY MEMORY

I've used regex with Python and Javascript but I've never used them with Java so that I tried to refresh my knowledge about this topic by doing some simple stuff like:
* Checking matching in **MatcherVerifier.java**
* Group capturing in **GroupCapture.java**
* Basic pattern matching in **PatternMatching.java** in order to know how Java handle groups and how to acces to those groups captured.
